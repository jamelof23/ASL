        "Purpose: Instead of updating the model weights after each individual sample, which can be computationally expensive and lead to noisy updates, the model processes a batch of samples and computes the gradient based on that batch. This approach helps to stabilize the training process and can lead to faster convergence.\n",
        "Common Values: Common batch sizes are powers of 2 (like 32, 64, 128) since they can be more efficient for hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs).\n",
        "2. Reproducibility\n",
        "Definition: Reproducibility refers to the ability to achieve the same results when you run the experiment multiple times under the same conditions.\n",
        "Purpose: In machine learning, due to the stochastic nature of algorithms (like random initialization of weights or shuffling of data), you might get different results on different runs. Setting a random seed (like seed=123 in the code) ensures that the random processes in your code (e.g., shuffling data or initializing weights) are the same every time you run the model. This way, you can replicate results and debug issues more easily.\n",
        "3. Shuffle the Dataset\n",
        "Definition: Shuffling the dataset means randomizing the order of the data samples before they are fed into the model for training.\n",
        "Purpose: Shuffling is important to ensure that the model does not learn any unintended patterns based on the order of the data (e.g., if all images of one class appear consecutively). Randomizing the input helps the model generalize better and improves performance."
